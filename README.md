## What is this?

This is a project where I attempted to make an in-depth fighting game engine in Unity. Given that the alternative to making a fighting game is UFE, I wanted to make something more accessible and deeper, with more freedom and customization

## Current Status: Pre-Alpha

The Current Status of this engine is still in the preliminary stages of development.

## Plans for the future

Rollback netcode and save-state-based features such as replays, training mode dummies, etc are the next big milestone.

## Getting Started

1) Clone the project
2) Open the project in the latest applicable version of Unity

## Liscense
